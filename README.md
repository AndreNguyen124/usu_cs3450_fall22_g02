## An explanation of the organization and name scheme for the workspace 
 - The organization of this project is composed of Emily Thomas as the agile scrum leader. Emily will be in charge of assigning and dividing tasks among the other team members.  Maris, Karl, and Andre will also be involved with the agile process, but mainly be focused on developing the software managed by Emily. 
 - Our team will have weekly meetings that will discuss what has been done and how our project is organized. At the moment, it seems that Karl is the front-end developer. Maris and Andre will mainly be involved with the backend. 

## Version-control procedures
 - Our version control will utilize Github. We will host our public repository there and use Git as our version control. 
 - For any new updates or features that will be added to the repository, the developer will fork the main repository and create a clone for their local machine. There, the developer will create a new branch with the feature and what task (from Jira) The developer will then merge that branch into a secondary main branch which will require 1-2 people to review the pull request before merging into the main branch.
